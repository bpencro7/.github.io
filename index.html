  <h3>What I Like To Do in My Spare Time</h3>
  <p>
    I like drawing and art in general. I have numerous sketch books filled with sketches. It is kind of strange how if one excels at pencil and ink drawing that can translate to pottery and/or sculpting. I guess it is like when one is good at football they are likely good at other sports too.
